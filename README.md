# ReactNativeBasics
This is a sample project done to get familiar with basic set of react native UI and functional components. 
Thanks to www.npmjs.com for providing enough resources to complete this project.

This is one project that i developed as part of learning React Native developement. So i've given more importance to the functional implementations rather than concentrating on building good looking UI. 

Some of the major features implemented with this project are : 

1. Redux Implementation with Thunk Middleware.
2. Navigation using react-native-router-flux.
3. Device Orientation change listener.
4. Websockets Implementation connected with echo server.
5. Pie Chart and Real time line graph implementation using HighCharts.
6. Dygraphs implementation of line graphs with dynamic x and y axis values based on zoom.
